## Custom Game Engine (C++) / Personal Project
Unity and Unreal felt too comfortable, and since I want to know what is happening under-the-hood, I'm attempting to build a custom game engine from scratch in C++ to deepen my understanding of low-level systems programming and real-time application architecture. By this, I get to have full controls of the systems I'm working on!

- Building using the Win32 API and custom rendering loop(in-progress)
- Attempting to implement an component-based-arhitecture
- Focused on modularity and extendability for future physics and rendering systems, such as plug-ins like my physics engine
- Current milestone: Window Management, Creating Game Loop, Application and Game Object Class\

## Physics Engine (C++) / Personal Project
Code Name: Faraday. 

Currently on the process of developing a Math Library like OpenGL Mathematics(GLM), and planning to have Fixed Update Loops, with Numerical Integrations.

## Algorithms & Systems (C#) / Academic Projects
A collection of algorithm and systems programming exercises exploring foundational CS topics.

Includes:
- Graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting and Pathfinding implementations
- Data structure experiments (queues, stacks, trees)
- Designed for problem-solving and systems design understanding

Located in this repository's Algorithms and Systems file

## Sweet Dreams (C#) / Academic Project
A Team Project with an objective to make a Top-Down Shooter game with the given time frame, adapting to Game Development Processes. Handled Drawing Start and User Interface buttons, and implemented my first camera class, which leads to my passion to understand the matrices to better understand how camera works.

## Mistique Menu (C#) / Personal Project
An on-going project for purposes to stay in-touch with my friend during the summer. At the previous project, Sweet Dreams, I have developed a Camera Class that was tied to the screen of the viewport, which was a bad design choice. Here, I worked with my friend who handled the render logic which rescales what the camera sees, and I have handled the Camera portion to only show the portion of the world, *decoupling the camera from the screen size*. That way, we were able to make the game run in full screen on any device!
